        "\n",
        "At the most fundamental level, machine learning can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Supervised learning* involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data.\n",
        "This is further subdivided into *classification* tasks and *regression* tasks: in classification, the labels are discrete categories, while in regression, the labels are continuous quantities.\n",
        ".\n",
        "\n",
        "*Unsupervised learning* involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label, and is often described as \"letting the dataset speak for itself.\"\n",
        "These models include tasks such as *clustering* and *dimensionality reduction.*\n",
        "Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, there are so-called *semi-supervised learning* methods, which falls somewhere between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
        "Semi-supervised learning methods are often useful when only incomplete labels are available.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Supervised learning*: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data\n",
        "\n",
        "  - *Classification*: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories (e.g. whether a picture shows a dog or a cat)\n",
        "  - *Regression*: Models that predict continuous labels\n",
        "  \n",
        "- *Unsupervised learning*: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data\n",
        "\n",
        "  - *Clustering*: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data\n",
        "  - *Dimensionality reduction*: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data\n",

        "While the theoretical aspects of these methodologies are sumarized in the physical booklet, the following chapters will show how we can practically use machine learning tools."
